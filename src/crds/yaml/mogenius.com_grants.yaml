          A mogenius `Grant` assigns permissions for mogenius `User` or `Team`
          resources to mogenius `Workspace` resources.

          In the first iteration we chose to keep existing hardcoded `Role` definitions as
          found ob the mogenius web platform ("viewer", "editor" and "admin"). These roles
          are only designed with the website in mind and are not yet speaking the same language
          as RBAC `Role` and `ClusterRole` resources.

          However this system could be easily extended by another resource (e.g. a mogenius `Role` resource)
          which could then allow in-depth configuration for what users should be allowed to do.
